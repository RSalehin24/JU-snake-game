# JavaScript-Snake-Game

### Features in Initial Project (will be used for modification by students):
- Initially snake should eat food but the snake size shouldn't increase
- Initially snake should kill itself if it hits the edges of the board
- Initially snake shouldn't get killed by hitting itself
- Initially snake food should appear randomly and stay until the snake is eating it.

### Features After Modification (after being implemented by the students):
- After some changes are made, the snake should eat food and increase in size
- After code modification, the snake should move through the wall in a circular way and eat food
- After code modification the snake should get killed by hitting itself
- After code modification, the snake food should appear in 2 different ways, the regular and some boosted food versions. For the boosted version, the food should appear randomly like regular but with a bit large size and will disappear after 5 seconds of its appearance
- After implementing the third feature, in the next step with some code modification, after hitting itself remaining body part from the hitting spot should disappear and the snake should survive and continue
- The speed of snake will change after eating a certain number of food, in short leveling up.
- There can be Life system, so let's say snake will have 3 life, so it can die 3 time before game over. There will be a random life spawning like the other "food", but instead of increasing snake length it will add life up to say 9 or 99

### Features present in GitHub Project:
- The snake can move throughout the board and eat the food.
- It gets bigger by one cell when it eats the food.
- The snake gets killed by hitting itself.
- The snake gets killed by hitting the edges of the board/canvas.

### Feature modifications in the GitHub Project:
- The snake won’t get bigger after eating the food
- Snake won’t be killed by hitting itself
